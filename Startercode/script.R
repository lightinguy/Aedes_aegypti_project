# For each location, the dots show the date of each record we have in the data.
# For the training data, this shows us when/where measurements were actually taken.
# But for the test data, we see a very regular set of locations/dates.  
# (This is because the test data has been filled in with many rows that don't always correspond to real measurements. 
# We need to make predictions for all of these rows, but only the ones corresponding to real measurements will be 
# used in scoring.)
